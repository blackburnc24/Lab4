# Moderna Vaccine Allocation
The data that I decided to use was acquired from the CDC and it was the moderna vaccine allocation for each states in the United States. 
Alaska was the only state that did not receive any vaccines from Moderna.
The data is raw, so it is not adjusted for by population size. Even though this is true, there are certain states with similar vaccine allocation numbers even though they are significantly different in population.
I think that a map like this is important because we can examine how well the vaccines are going to certain states. 
The graduated circles of some states overlap other states, but this just goes to show that some states have gotten increased numbers of vaccines compared to others.
